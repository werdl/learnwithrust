# Basic Syntax
Syntax is the set of rules that defines the combinations of symbols that are considered to be correctly structured programs in that language. It's the grammar of a programming language, though is much more strict than the grammar of a natural language like English.

In this chapter, we'll learn about the basic syntax of Rust, including comments, data types, variables, control flow, and functions. We'll learn about more advanced syntax in later chapters.
