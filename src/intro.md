# Introduction
Hello, and welcome to the Rust for Beginners tutorial! This is not official (sanctioned by the Rust team), but rather an experiment in teaching Rust to those who are new not only to Rust, but to programming in general. This tutorial is a work in progress, and will be updated as I have time to work on it. If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions, please feel free to open an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/werdl/learnwithrust)
## Prerequisites
- In order to follow this tutorial, you will need:
    - A computer with an internet connection (and a basic understanding of how to use it)
    - A text editor
    - A terminal (don't worry, we'll cover what this is later)
- You don't need any prior programming experience, and you don't need to have Rust installed. We'll cover that in the next section.
## What is Rust?
- Rust is a programming language, which is a tool that tells a computer what to do in a manner writable (and readable) by humans.
### Who?
- Rust was created by Graydon Hoare, a Mozilla employee, and is now maintained by the Rust team at Mozilla.
### Why?
- Rust was created to solve problems that other programming languages have. It is designed to be fast, safe, and concurrent (meaning it can do multiple things at once).
### Where?
- Rust has a series of high-importance targets (places where it is important to be able to run Rust code), including:
    - The web (via WebAssembly)
    - Embedded systems (like the software that runs on your microwave)
    - Operating systems (like Windows, macOS, and Linux)
### When?
- Rust was first released in 2010, and has been in active development ever since.
- It is currently in stable release, meaning that it is ready for use in production (real-world) applications, and that the language will not change in ways that break existing code.
### How?
- Rust is a compiled language, meaning that it is turned into machine code (the language that computers understand) before it is run.
- Rust is statically typed, meaning that the types (whether it is a number, a string, a list etc.) of variables (data values) are known at compile time (when the code is turned into machine code).
## What will we learn?
- In this tutorial, we will cover the basics of Rust, including:
    - Installing Rust
    - Writing and running a simple program
    - Variables and types
    - Functions
    - Control flow (if statements, loops, etc.)
    - Error handling
    - Modules and packages
    - Testing
    - Documentation
    - and more!
- Don't worry if you don't understand what any of that means yet. We'll cover it all in detail as we go along.
