# Google
Google? What is it doing here, in a book about Rust? Googling is a skill - you can't just paste in your code!
## How to Google
When you're learning a new programming language, you'll often run into problems that you don't know how to solve. In these cases, it's important to know how to use Google effectively to find the information you need.

Here are some tips for using Google to find answers to your programming questions:
- Be specific: When you're searching for information about a specific programming language or library, be as specific as possible in your search query. For example, if you're looking for information about the `Vec` type in Rust, you might search for "Rust Vec type" or "Rust Vec documentation" rather than just "Rust documentation."
- Use quotes: If you're looking for information about a specific term or phrase, you can use quotes to search for that exact phrase. For example, if you're looking for information about the `unwrap` method in Rust, you might search for "Rust unwrap method" rather than just "Rust unwrap."
- Use the right keywords: When you're searching for information about a specific programming concept, make sure to use the right keywords in your search query. For example, if you're looking for information about error handling in Rust, you might search for "Rust error handling" or "Rust Result type" rather than just "Rust errors."
### Google Search Operators
Google has a number of search operators that you can use to refine your search queries. Here are a few of the most useful ones:
- `site:`: Use this operator to search for information on a specific website. For example, if you want to search for information about the `Vec` type on the Rust documentation website, you might search for "site:doc.rust-lang.org Vec type."
- `filetype:`: Use this operator to search for files of a specific type. For example, if you're looking for a PDF file about error handling in Rust, you might search for "filetype:pdf Rust error handling."
- `related:`: Use this operator to find websites that are related to a specific website. For example, if you want to find other websites that are similar to the Rust documentation website, you might search for "related:doc.rust-lang.org."
- `intitle:`: Use this operator to search for pages with a specific word or phrase in the title. For example, if you're looking for pages about error handling in Rust that have "Rust" in the title, you might search for "intitle:Rust error handling."
## Conclusion
Learning how to use Google effectively is an important skill for any programmer. By using the right search queries and search operators, you can find the information you need to solve your programming problems and continue learning and growing as a programmer.
