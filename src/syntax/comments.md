# Comments
## What are comments?
- Comments are a way to write text in your code that is not executed by the computer.
- They are like a note to yourself, or to anyone else who reads your code, to explain what the code is doing.
- Comments are ignored by the computer, so you can write whatever you want in them.
- They are a great way to explain your code, and to remind yourself what you were thinking when you wrote it.
## Single-line comments
- Single-line comments start with `//` and continue until the end of the line.
- They are great for writing short notes about a single line of code.
- For example:
```rust
// This is a single-line comment
let x = 5; // This is another single-line comment
```

## Multi-line comments
- Multi-line comments start with `/*` and end with `*/`.
- They are great for writing longer notes about multiple lines of code.
- For example:
```rust
/*
This is a multi-line comment
It can span multiple lines
*/
let x = 5; /* This is another multi-line comment, even though it is on only one line */
```
