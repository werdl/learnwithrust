# CLI App
In this chapter, we will build a simple command line application. We will use the `clap` crate to parse command line arguments, and we will also cover error handling, testing, and documentation.
## What We Will Build
We will build a simple command line application that takes a file name as an argument and prints the contents of the file to the terminal. If the file does not exist, we will print an error message.
## What is a CLI, Anyway?
A CLI, or Command Line Interface, is a way to interact with a computer program using text commands. CLIs are often used for system administration tasks, and they are also used for many developer tools. For example, the `rustc` compiler and the `cargo` package manager are both command line tools.
