# Terminals
## Introduction
In this section, we will cover what a terminal is, and how to use it. If you are already familiar with terminals, feel free to skip this section.
## What is a terminal?
- A terminal is a program that allows you to interact with your computer using text commands.
- You might have seen it in movies or TV shows, where a character is typing furiously on a black screen with white (or sometimes green) text.
- This is a terminal, and it is a powerful tool for interacting with your computer.
## Why use a terminal?
- There are many reasons to use a terminal, including:
    - It is faster than using a mouse and graphical user interface (GUI)
    - It is more powerful than a GUI
    - It is more flexible than a GUI
    - It is more efficient than a GUI
    - It is more fun than a GUI
- To compile the Rust code we write, we will need to use a terminal, so it's important to be familiar(ish) with it.
## How to use a terminal
### Windows (if you don't know what operating system you're using, it's probably Windows)
1. Open the Start menu (or press Win+R)
2. Type "powershell" and press Enter
3. You should see a blue window with white text. This is the terminal.
### macOS
1. Open the Finder
2. Go to Applications > Utilities
3. Open Terminal
### Linux
1. Open your application menu
2. Search for "terminal" and open it
3. If this doesn't work, try pressing Ctrl+Alt+T, or searching online for how to open a terminal on your specific distribution (or "distro") of Linux
## Basic commands
- `cd` - Change Directory
- `ls` (on Windows sometimes `dir`) - List files and directories
