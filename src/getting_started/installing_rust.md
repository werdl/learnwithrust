# Installing Rust
Before we can start writing Rust code, we need to install Rust. This is a simple process, and should only take a few minutes.
## Windows (if you don't know what operating system you're using, it's probably Windows)
1. Open your web browser and go to [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs)
2. Click on the button that says "rustup-init.exe" to download the installer
3. Once the installer has finished downloading, run it
4. Follow the instructions in the installer
## POSIX and POSIX-like systems (like macOS and Linux)
1. Open your terminal
2. Run the following command:
```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```
3. Follow the instructions in the installer
